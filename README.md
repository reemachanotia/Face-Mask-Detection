Project Overview
Face mask detection has become crucial in the context of public health to ensure compliance with safety measures. This project aims to develop a robust model to automatically detect face masks in images using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes images of people with and without face masks. It is sourced from public datasets available on platforms like Kaggle. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/reemachanotia/Face-Mask-Detection
cd face_mask_detection
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution of images, class balance, and other patterns. This step helps in identifying any preprocessing needs.

Modeling
The project uses traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for image classification. Image processing techniques like histogram equalization and edge detection are employed to enhance feature extraction.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices are also used to provide detailed insights into model predictions.

Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting face masks in various conditions.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in face mask detection, providing a tool that can be integrated into public health monitoring systems to enhance safety and compliance.
